I am excited to share my latest project – a Tic Tac Toe game! This project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here’s a brief overview:

# Technologies Used:

HTML: For structuring the game board and layout.
CSS: For styling the game interface, including shadows, backgrounds, and transitions.
JavaScript: For adding interactivity, handling game logic, and managing player turns.

# Features:

Interactive Game Board: A 3x3 grid where players can click to place their marks (X or O).
Win Detection: The game detects when a player wins based on the predefined winning patterns.
Reset Functionality: A button to reset the game, allowing players to start a new game without refreshing the page.

# Design Notes:

The design is kept simple and clean with a modern look, using a subtle neon glow effect for the X and O marks.
The game board has a dark, textured background to enhance the visual appeal.
The game is not responsive, so it is best viewed on desktop screens.
